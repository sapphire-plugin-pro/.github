1. Built For Speed And Excellence
Sapphire is built for the pros. Its suite of over 270 effects features image processing algorithms that produce Hollywood’s highest-quality results. Each Sapphire effect is GPU-accelerated for faster rendering with NVIDIA CUDA technology for Windows and Linux, and Apple’s Metal technology for macOS, along with native support for M1-powered Macs. Look no further if you’re a professional artist looking to create an array of stunning visuals with blazing speeds.

You’ll always find something to suit your taste and needs with over 3000 preset effects crafted by top-notch artists. Every Sapphire release includes brand new presets. There’s always something fresh to play with!
3. Learn The Language Of Sapphire
Sapphire effects are loved for a beautifully designed and carefully laid out top-down parameter workflow often structured with a guided order of operations. The user-friendly experience — paired with a uniform naming structure and speedy workflow — makes it easy for editors and artists to start creating gorgeous effects. Sapphire also features a large online library of tutorials to teach you about the effects or provide you with inspiration on what to create next!
